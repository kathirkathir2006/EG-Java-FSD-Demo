1. Write a Java program to create and display a unique three-digit number using 1, 2, 3, 4. Also count how many three-digit numbers are there.

123   143   132    134
241    234   132   342
....
....

   2. Write a Java program to print odd numbers from 1 to 99. Prints one number per line.
3. Write a Java program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
   **Sample Output:**
   Input number: 5                                                        
   5 + 55  + 555

4. Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}
What are the class variables?

What are the instance variables?

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);
