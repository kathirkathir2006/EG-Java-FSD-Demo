  4. Problem: Unique Substrings Counter

You are given a string . Your task is to find the count of unique substrings present in 

A substring of S is any contiguous sequence of characters within 
A substring is considered unique if it does not match with any other substrings in the given string, including itself.

Write a Java function to calculate and return the count of unique substrings in 

**Function Signature:**

public static int countUniqueSubstrings(String s)

**Input Format:**
Input Format:

A string s of length 
N (1≤≤1000 1≤N≤1000).

**Output Format:**

An integer representing the count of unique substrings in 
**Sample Input:**

``` "abcabc" ```
**Sample Output:**
	``` 12 ```
**Explanation:**
The unique substrings in the given string "abcabc" are:

a
ab
abc
abca
abcab
abcabc
b
bc
bca
bcab
bcabc
c
Hence, the total count of unique substrings is 12.

Complete the function countUniqueSubstrings to achieve this.
